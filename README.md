# NebulaUsingCSS
Creative CSS experiment using radial gradients, blend modes, and a starry background image to simulate a nebula effect.

# 🌌 Nebula Background Experiment

This is a small creative experiment in web development where I combined a **radial-gradient color palette** with a **starscape background image** using advanced `background-blend-mode` techniques. The goal was to create a nebula-like visual effect using just CSS.

---

## 🎨 What I Used

- A beautiful color palette inspired by a Google search for "nebula colors".
- A stars background image from Adobe Stock.
- CSS properties like:
  - `background-image`
  - `radial-gradient`
  - `background-blend-mode`
  - `background-size`, `position`, and `repeat`

---

## 🧪 What I Learned

- How to layer multiple background images and gradients.
- How different `blend-modes` interact with light and color.
- That even small design experiments can teach a lot about visual hierarchy and creativity in CSS.
